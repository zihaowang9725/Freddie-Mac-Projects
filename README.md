# Project Purposoe

- Learn how to transit from exploratory data analysis to data modeling. 
- Gain finalcial industry domain knowledge and analytics skill - Although the data used is mortgage data, the same method and some domain knowledge are also applicable to credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, and other fields.
- Know how to apply modeling skills to some similar fields - Some specific modeling methods are also applicable to marketing applications such as direct mail campaigns. 
- Build project management/documentation skills by self-design project steps - The project description deliberately uses a format similar to model documentation.
